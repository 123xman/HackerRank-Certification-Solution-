# java(basic)
## 1. **Java:** Shapes

Define the following 2 classes to represent 2-dimensional objects.

**Super Class:** Shape (It should have)
* 2 member variables: length, and breadth of integer types.
* 2 argument constructor for length and breadth which stores the arguments in their corresponding member variables.
* A method, area(), which prints the length and breadth of the shape, delimited by a space.

**Concrete Class:** Rectangle (It should have)
* 2 argument constructor for length and breadth. It should forward those arguments to the superclass constructor.
* Override the area() method to print the area using the formula (length*breadth).
